- 👋 Hi, I’m @rileystacey
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new coding skills to enable a career change, as well as history, football, and my side-hustle in the events industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and React after using online tutorials to master the basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would further my skills, challenge me, and could provide references in my search for my first role.
- 📫 How to reach me ... rileystaceyopus@gmail.com or tweet @staceyriley.
